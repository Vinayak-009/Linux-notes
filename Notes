//File system in linux 


how to check your file system : lsblk -f

file system structure :

/boot: files used by boot loader(grub)
/dev: system devices files (speaker,keyboard)
/etc:configuration files 
/usr/bin:Binaries
/opt:installation of add-on applications
/proc:running processes
/usr/lib: C program library files used by commands and apps
/tmp: temporary files
/home:directories of users
/root:home directory of root user
/var: system logs
/run:system daemons that start very early
/mnt:to mount external filesystem
/media: for CDROM Mounts

------FIND AND LOCATE----------------

find [starting_directory] [options] [expression]
eg: find /home/user -name "*.txt"

locate [options] pattern
eg:locate *.txt
sudo updatedb


diff: if u write incomplete name of your file you'll not get any result using find command 
-------GREP------------

grep [options] pattern [file(s)]  
eg: grep "pattern" filename.txt
//grep is case sensitive. To ignore this use grep -i
grep -e "word1" -e "word2" filename //to use multiple words in a file
-n: This option prints the line numbers along with the lines that match the specified pattern.
-c: This option counts the number of lines that match the pattern instead of printing the lines themselves.

------FIND----------
find [starting_directory] [options] [expression]
eg: find . -type f //we are specifying we r searching for a file.
eg:find /path/to/directory -type d -name "example" //Find directories with a specific name

---------PIPING------------
Count files in a folder: ls -1 | wc -l . -1 for line by line names ,wc -l to count no of lines .

Combine both files content using cat and sort: cat file1 file2 | sort

Find Unique records from a file : cat filename | sort | uniq

See only 30-37th line from a file : cat filename | head -38 | tail -1

------------TEE-------------------

ls | tee test.txt  //The tee command in Linux is used to read from standard input and write to both standard output and one or more files simultaneously.
it is useful cuz it shows and saves the output in a file   

--------WILDCARDS------------

To list all xml files : ls -l *.xml
To make 20 files with name file1-20: touch file{1..20}
To search for files that starts with any digit but ends with 123: ls -l ?123
To search words that starts with R using Grep: cat filename | grep ^R
To search words that ends with am using Grep: cat filename | grep am$

-----------GZIP---------------- MAJOR ISSUE : doesn't zip directories----
gzip filename (To compress files)
gunzip filename (To decompress files)
Note: if u compress a file using gzip command then u cannot extract it using tar.it can be only done through gunzip

-------------TAR-----------
tar cvf name.tar file_path
tar xvf name.tar file_path
tar -tf archive_file.tar.gz (show content in zip file)
tar -zcvf name.tar.gz file_path 

----------CHMOD-----------------

Type of Permissions: r-read , w-write , x-execute
Permission levels: u-yourself(current user),g-group,o-others,a-all
drwxr-xr-x  onwer(rwx),group(rx),o(rx)
Change permissions: symbolic mode-> chmod u[user]=rwx[read,write,execute] ; chmod go=rwx ;
Binary mode -> read=4,write=2,execute=1 chmod 777 [filename]


---------ACCESS CONTROL LIST------------------------
To give permission to specific user 
getfacl filename (gives permission details)

setfacl -m u:user:rwx filename   To add permission for user
setfacl -m g:group:rwx filename  To add permission for group
setfacl -x u:user:rwx filename   To remove a specific entry
setfacl -b filename              To remove all entries


----------HARD LINKS AND SOFT LINKS--------------
Points to the location of the file 
SOFT LINK: link will be removed if original file is deleted
ln -s path (softlink name)

HARD LINK: renaming , Deleting or removing the file will not effect the link
ln filepath

----------ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES-----------------

To View env variables : printenv (For all env variables)
echo $HOME : To check value of a particular env variable(This case it's host)

To set environment variable temporary use export command
export TESTVAR=1

To set environment variable permanent (applicable for a specific user)
nano .bashrc
export TESTVAR=abc
source .bashrc

To set environment variable permanent (applicable for all users)

nano etc/profile
export TESTVAR=abc
source .bashrc

To unset environment variable

unset $VARNAME

---------PROCESS-----------
ps

ps -e [tell us all the running process]
ps -ef [full format]
ps aux
eg To check apache server is running or not : pd -ef | grep httpd
ps -u [username]  see process by user
ps -G [groupname] see process by group

----------KILL-----------------
kill [options] [PID] //To see options, type kill -l
kill -1 PID (To rstart process)
kill -2 PID  (interrupt from keyboard like ctrl+c)
kill -9 PID  (Forcefully terminate the process)
kill -15 PID  (Kill the process gracefully)

 
---------PROCESS MANAGEMENT----------------------

jobs: will show active jobs
bg: resume jobs to the background
fg: resume jobs to the foreground
bg %<jobid> resume a specific job in background
To check nice value: ps -l PID  -20(high priority)- 19(low priority)
To change nice value: nice -n -10 file

-------NOHUP----------------
nohup script &
nohup process>/dev/null 2>&1 &

-------SYSTEM MONITORING-----------
df:shows info about file system:  df -h
du:summarize disk usage:    du -h filepath
free: display amount of free memory : free -h

-----------DMESG----------------
dmesg 
dmesg -HTx (human readable,timestamp,decode)


-----------SUID-------------
chmod u+s filename
 
-------STICKY BIT------------
only file owner, dir owner can delete or rename a file or directory
chmod o+t folder/file 

--------CHOWN---CHGRP----------
To change owner and group
chown -c (username) (filename)
chgrp -c --same--

--------CRON JOB--------------
In Linux, a cron job is a scheduled task that runs automatically at specified intervals. Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems.
To view your current cron jobs, use:crontab -l
To remove all your cron jobs, use:crontab -r
To edit the crontab file, open a terminal and type:crontab -e
eg:0 2 * * * /path/to/script.sh >> /path/to/logfile 2>&1

----------SSH----------------
port no. 22
systemctl status sshd
ssh username@hostname -p 22
To transfer files between two users on the same machine using SSH, you can use the scp (secure copy) command:
scp username2@hostname2:/path/to/source/file username1@hostname1:/path/to/destination/directory
Generate SSH key pair:ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
Copy SSH public key to remote server:ssh-copy-id username@hostname
Restart SSH service:service ssh restart
View active SSH connections:who




----SETUP Linux Apache Web Server HTTPD---------------------

yum install httpd
config location: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
/var/www/html/index.html
logs: log var/log/httpd
systemctl start httpd (To start the server)
ip addr (copy the ip and place it in browser)
systemctl status firewalld.service (To check status of firewall)
systemctl stop firewalld.service (To stop service of firewall)
